#### In this project our team has created an application that is capable of reading active and static streams of video format and with &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;pipes-and-filters pattern we change the output to the desired result.
For significantly more details, please refer to [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m25qU_UYThHWVS_T-SAfj_AEN88bFfTM/view?usp=drive_link).

## Here is the list of the used libraries:
1. tkinter for creating the window of the application
2. Pillow for processing individual pictures
3. OpenCV2 for access to the camera(s)

  And basic libraries: multiprocessing, time, and threading

## To install all the libraries you may run
```
pip install pillow opencv-python cv2_enumerate_cameras
```
All you need to do now is open main.py and enjoy.
